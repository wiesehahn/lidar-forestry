### Near Real-Time Forest Monitoring

"build on existing applications of ALS-derived enhanced inventories and integrate them with data from satellite constellations of free and open, analysis-ready moderate spatial resolution imagery" [@coopsFrameworkRealtimeForest2023]

"Networking the forest infrastructure towards near real-time monitoring. should be supplemented by near real-time remote sensing data." [@zweifelNetworkingForestInfrastructure2023]
