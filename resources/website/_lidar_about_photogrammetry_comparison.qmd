### Comparison to photogrammetry

Point clouds or height information in general can also be calculated from from overlapping optical images. Image-based point clouds, also known as photogrammetry point clouds, are created by using multiple images of a scene taken from different perspectives and using software to triangulate the position of objects or surfaces in the scene. This process is known as Structure from Motion (SfM).

There are several key differences between image-based point clouds and lidar-derived point clouds:

- Resolution: Lidar-derived point clouds typically have a higher resolution than image-based point clouds, especially in the z-axis (vertical direction). This is because lidar sensors are able to measure the distance to multiple objects if there are tiny gaps (e.g. in the canopy). Image-based point clouds usually only cover the upper-most layer since points in the lower layers typically cannot be senn and matched in multiple images. 
- Color: Image-based point clouds typically have color information associated with them, while lidar-derived point clouds do not. However, the color information can be added to the lidar point clouds by overlapping them with RGB imagery in postprocessing.
- Light condition: Lidar sensors are able to capture data in a wider range of lighting conditions than cameras, including in low light or complete darkness, while orthoimagery very much depends on the illumination conditions (sun, clouds, shadows, haze,...).
- Surface detection: Lidar sensors are able to detect surfaces that are difficult to see with cameras, such as surfaces that are very dark, very reflective, or very transparent.

Both techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages, and are often used together in applications such as mapping, surveying, and 3D modeling. Lidar data can be used to provide a highly accurate and detailed representation of the environment, while image-based data can provide information on the color and texture of surfaces. 

"Comparisons revealed that ALS metrics provided a more detailed characterization of the canopy surface including canopy openings. 
Change detection between ALS-derived CHM (time 1) and DSI-derived CHM (time 2) provided change estimates that demonstrated good agreement (r = 0.71) with two-date, ALS only, change outputs.
For the single-layered, even-aged stands the DSI-derived vertical information is appropriate.
ALS is more suitable for capturing stand density." [@vastarantaAirborneLaserScanning2013]

"The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade"[@whiteRemoteSensingTechnologies2016]

"Digital airborne imagery is typically less costly to acquire than ALS, is well understood by inventory practitioners, and in addition to enabling the derivation of height information, allows for visual interpretation of attributes that are currently problematic to estimate from ALS (such as species, health status, and maturity). 
Image-based point clouds primarily characterize the outer envelope of the forest canopy, whereas ALS pulses penetrate the canopy and provide information on sub-canopy forest structure." [@whiteUtilityImageBasedPoint2013]

"Analyses comparing area-based estimates for DAP and ALS have found that accuracies can be considered analogous (although ALS data is generally more accurate), with DAP acquisitions being considerably less expensive relative to ALS." [@goodbodyDigitalAerialPhotogrammetry2019]

"ALS produced significantly better estimations than the SfM metrics for all the variables of interest" [@rodriguez-vivancosAnalysisStructureMotion2022]

"research indicate the successful application of SfM photogrammetry in forestry, in an operational context and in research, delivering results that are comparable to LiDAR surveys." [@iglhautStructureMotionPhotogrammetry2019]

"both ALS and DAP models were suitable for predicting the five forest attributes in the five separate inventories, however ALS models performed better" [@noordermeerComparingAccuraciesForest2019]

"Given the known quality and consistency of ALS-derived forest inventory attributes, these data are highly desired by forest managers and practitioners. The higher cost of ALS over photointerpretation-based forest inventory has meant that in some jurisdictions, ALS data are strategically obtained over areas of high interest or value. Such a calculated implementation strategy allows for the benefits of ALS-derived inventories to be captured over specific areas, while minimizing costs of data acquisition, processing and modelling, among other considerations."
