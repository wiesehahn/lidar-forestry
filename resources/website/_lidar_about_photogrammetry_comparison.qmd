### Comparison to photogrammetry

Point clouds or height information in general can also be calculated from from overlapping optical images. Image-based point clouds, also known as photogrammetry point clouds, are created by using multiple images of a scene taken from different perspectives and using software to triangulate the position of objects or surfaces in the scene. This process is known as Structure from Motion (SfM).

There are several key differences between image-based point clouds and lidar-derived point clouds:

- Resolution: Lidar-derived point clouds typically have a higher resolution than image-based point clouds, especially in the z-axis (vertical direction). This is because lidar sensors are able to measure the distance to multiple objects if there are tiny gaps (e.g. in the canopy). Image-based point clouds usually only cover the upper-most layer since points in the lower layers typically cannot be senn and matched in multiple images. 
- Color: Image-based point clouds typically have color information associated with them, while lidar-derived point clouds do not. However, the color information can be added to the lidar point clouds by overlapping them with RGB imagery in postprocessing.
- Light condition: Lidar sensors are able to capture data in a wider range of lighting conditions than cameras, including in low light or complete darkness, while orthoimagery very much depends on the illumination conditions (sun, clouds, shadows, haze,...).
- Surface detection: Lidar sensors are able to detect surfaces that are difficult to see with cameras, such as surfaces that are very dark, very reflective, or very transparent.

Both techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages, and are often used together in applications such as mapping, surveying, and 3D modeling. Lidar data can be used to provide a highly accurate and detailed representation of the environment, while image-based data can provide information on the color and texture of surfaces.
