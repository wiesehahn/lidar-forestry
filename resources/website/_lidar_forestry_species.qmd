"mapping of tree speciesâ€”subdivided into conifers and broadleaf trees" [@krzystekLargeScaleMappingTree2020]

"This paper compares the same method of tree species identification (at the individual crown level) across three different types of airborne laser scanning systems (ALS): two linear lidar systems (monospectral and multispectral) and one single-photon lidar (SPL) system. The additional intensity features that are provided by multispectral ALS appear to be more beneficial to overall accuracy than the higher point density of SPL." [@prieurComparisonThreeAirborne2021]

"laser scanning data was used to mask pixels with low or no vegetation" [@trierTreeSpeciesClassification2018]
