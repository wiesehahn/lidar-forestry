#### Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
A Digital Elevation Model is a digital representation of the elevation of the Earthâ€™s surface typically above mean sea level. There are two types of DEMs, Digital surface models and Digital Terrain models, briefly described below. 

#### Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
A Digital Terrain Model approximates the continuous terrain surface by a set of discrete points with unique height values. The DTM does not include features like buildings or trees.

#### Digital Surface Model (DSM)
A Digital Surface Model is created by the interpolation of individual points containing the elevation characteristics of natural or human-made elements such as trees, buildings etc.
