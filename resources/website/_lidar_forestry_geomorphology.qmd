### Geomorphometry

Geomorphometry is the use of quantitative methods and tools to measure, analyze, and interpret the physical characteristics of the Earth's surface. This includes the measurement of topographic features such as elevation, slope, and aspect, as well as the characterization of landforms such as rivers, valleys, and hills. The goal of geomorphometry is to understand the processes that shape the Earth's surface and how they have changed over time.
It is applied in various disciplines such as geology, geography, environmental science, and civil engineering. The information and knowledge generated by geomorphometry can be used for a wide range of applications, such as natural resource management, land-use planning, hazard assessment, and infrastructure development.

Lidar can be used to map cultural heritage sites (archeology, bomb craters, ...)

"show that imprints from past land uses and management practices can still be captured today through well-chosen LiDAR-derived variables describing, at sub-decimetre scale, the vertical and horizontal micro-variations of vegetation and terrain structure hidden below treetops." [@lenoirUnveilUnseenUsing2022]

"increasing availability of light detection and ranging data presents new opportunities to apply digital soil mapping to support forest resource applications at multiple scales. This project describes a digital soil mapping workflow using LiDAR-derived elevation data and machine learning models  to predict key forest soil attributes." [@blackfordDigitalSoilMapping2021]
