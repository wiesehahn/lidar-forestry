Project IntelliWay – Intelligente Wege – Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance for forest tracks (https://kwf2020.kwf-online.de/portfolio/intelliway/)

"addresses the problem of the automatic updating, fixing, and enhancement of vectorial forestry road maps over large landscapes" [@rousselCorrectionUpdateEnhancement2022]
