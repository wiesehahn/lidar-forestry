### Forest Stand Inventory

Integration of Photo Interpreted and LIDAR Attributes Into a Polygonal Forest Inventory Framework (https://bermane.github.io/ontario-inventory/)

"map Site Index over large areas of forest automatically, depicting forest productivity at a much finer spatial resolution than what is common in operational inventories." [@noordermeerPredictingMappingSite2020]

"an approach to develop Site Index models from ALS data" [@tompalskiModelingSiteIndex2022]

"the degree of transferability depends more on the attribute being modelled or the modeling approach applied, and less on the characteristics of the point cloud data." [@tompalskiDemonstratingTransferabilityForest2019]

"dense Laser scanning-based inventory provided more accurate stand estimates than field-based demonstrations" [@perssonTwophaseForestInventory2022]

"explore the potential of LiDAR and other geospatial information sources to model and predict wood quality based on individual-tree and stand structural metrics." [@vanleeuwenAssessmentStandingWood2011]

"a conceptual framework for forestry inventory update, which is also known as the establishment of a ‘living inventory’." [@coopsFrameworkRealtimeForest2023]
