"a novel methodology that isolates CWD returns from large diameter logs (>30cm) using a refined grounding algorithm, a mixture of height and pulse-based filters and linear pattern recognition, to transform ALS returns into measurable, vectorized shapes." [@jarronDetectionQuantificationCoarse2021]

Fallen tree mapping provides valuable information regarding the ecological value of boreal forests. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) enables mapping fallen trees on a large scale. [@heinaroEvaluatingFactorsImpacting2023]

"Our results demonstrate that airborne LiDAR can be used to detect CWD. LiDAR-based detection and mapping of CWD will be most useful for applications that focus on larger and longer pieces of CWD or applications focused on total CWD volume." [@joyceDetectionCoarseWoody2019]

"Moderate-density LiDAR data enables detecting ecologically most significant trunks." [@heinaroAirborneLaserScanning2021]
