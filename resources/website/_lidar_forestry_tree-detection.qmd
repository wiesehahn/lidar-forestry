### Individual Tree Detection

"assessed seven ITD methods, representing three common approaches (point-cloud-based, raster-based, hybrid), across coniferous forest stands with diverse structure and composition to understand how ITD and height measurement accuracy vary with method, input parameters and data, and stand density." [@sparksCrossComparisonIndividualTree2022]

"aimed to develop a tool for individual tree detection (ITD) utilising a self-calibrating algorithm procedure and to verify its accuracy using the complicated forest structure of near natural forests in the temperate zone." [@sterenczakMappingIndividualTrees2020]

"This article describes algorithms to extract tree crowns using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) segmentation. For all combinations of algorithms and data resolutions, undetected trees accounted for, on average, 0â€“5% of the total stem volume in the field plots." [@holmgrenTreeCrownSegmentation2022]

"Numerous semi- and fully-automatic algorithms have been developed for individual tree detection from airborne laser-scanning data" [@brodicRefinementIndividualTree2022]
