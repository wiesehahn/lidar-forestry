### Biomass estimation

Laser scanning reveals potential underestimation of biomass carbon in temperate forest [@caldersLaserScanningReveals2022].

"even with the highest average pulse density of 11 pulses/m2, at least 25% of the forest canopy volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions" [@kukenbrinkQuantificationHiddenCanopy2017]

"practical solutions to challenges faced in using spatiotemporal patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for AGB prediction and mapping in support of broad-scale applications in forest carbon accounting and ecosystem stewardship" [@johnsonFineresolutionLandscapescaleBiomass2022]

"national forest inventory (NFI) data was used as reference data for modeling forest basal area, volume, above-ground biomass, and total biomass from laser scanning data obtained in a countrywide scanning survey." [@nord-larsenEstimationForestResources2012]

"this study confirm the utility of LiDAR for estimating wood volume in deciduous broad-leafed forest, but highlight the challenges associated with field plot size and number" [@levickScalingWoodVolume2016]

"found TLS biomass estimates were consistently more precise across species (RMSE = ~19%) than nation-scale allometry (RMSE = ~39%). Nondestructive biomass estimates from TLS are a suitable addition to or replacement for traditional sampling methods. 
Although optical and airborne LiDAR are unable to fully capture understorey trees due to occlusion, the easily measured canopy trees dominate the biomass." [@stovallDevelopingNondestructiveSpecies2023]

"accounted for uncertainties in both the individual tree-level biomass models and the models linking plot level biomass predictions with LiDAR metrics.
75% of the mean square error was due to the uncertainty associated with tree-level models." [@saarelaMappingAbovegroundBiomass2020]
