Laser scanning reveals potential underestimation of biomass carbon in temperate forest [@caldersLaserScanningReveals2022].

"practical solutions to challenges faced in using spatiotemporal patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for AGB prediction and mapping in support of broad-scale applications in forest carbon accounting and ecosystem stewardship" [@johnsonFineresolutionLandscapescaleBiomass2022]

"national forest inventory (NFI) data was used as reference data for modeling forest basal area, volume, above-ground biomass, and total biomass from laser scanning data obtained in a countrywide scanning survey." [@nord-larsenEstimationForestResources2012]
