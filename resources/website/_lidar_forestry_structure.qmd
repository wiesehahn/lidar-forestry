### Forest structure

"Ecosystem structure, especially vertical vegetation structure, is one of the six essential biodiversity variable classes and is an important aspect of habitat heterogeneity, affecting species distributions and diversity by providing shelter, foraging, and nesting sites. Point clouds from airborne laser scanning (ALS) can be used to derive such detailed information on vegetation structure." [@moudryVegetationStructureDerived2023]

"With the increasing density of ALS point clouds, new opportunities exist to describe sub-canopy structural components in forests that were previously difficult to detect using passive remote sensing technologies." [@jarronDetectionSubcanopyForest2020]

"The porosity of tree belts is expressed by gap fraction under and inside the canopy." [@nowakHiddenGapsCanopy2022]

"compare crown metrics derived from TLS, ALS, and a combination of both for describing the crown structure and fuel attributes" [@rochaCrownLevelStructureFuel2023]

"Recent advances in remote sensing and data processing are revolutionising our ability to accurately measure tree and forest structure from leaves to landscapes." [@linesShapeTreesReimagining2022]

"Models utilising leaf-off LiDAR diversity variables described DBH diversity, crown length diversity and crown width diversity more successfully than leaf-on." [@davisonEffectLeafonLeafoff2020]

#### Forest canopy gaps

"report large-scale estimates of Amazonian gap dynamics using a novel approach with large datasets of airborne light detection and ranging" [@dalagnolLargescaleVariationsDynamics2021]

"compared the performance of LiDAR and DAP data for characterizing canopy openings. 
recommend that operational use of DAP in forests be limited to mapping large canopy openings" [@dietmaierComparisonLiDARDigital2019]

#### Leaf Area Index

"airborne laser scanning can be applied to map effective leaf area
index" [@solbergMappingLAINorway2009]

"Airborne Laser Scanning has been considered as a primary source to model the structure and function of a forest canopy through the indicators leaf area index (LAI) and vertical canopy profiles of leaf area density (LAD). Stable LAD profile were obtained when the grain size was less than 10 m and pulse density was high (>15 pulses mÂ²)." (in tropical forests) [@almeidaOptimizingRemoteDetection2019]

"LAD estimates from airborne LiDAR can be used to describe the three-dimensional structure of forests across entire landscapes. This information can help inform forest management and conservation decisions related to the estimation of aboveground biomass and productivity, the response of forests to large-scale disturbances, the impacts of drought on forest health, the conservation of bird habitat, as well as a host of other important forest processes and responses."
