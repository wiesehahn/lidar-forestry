> Laser scanning reveals potential underestimation of biomass carbon in temperate forest [@caldersLaserScanningReveals2022].

> even with the highest average pulse density of 11 pulses/mÂ², at least 25% of the forest canopy volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions [@kukenbrinkQuantificationHiddenCanopy2017]

> practical solutions to challenges faced in using spatiotemporal patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for AGB prediction and mapping in support of broad-scale applications in forest carbon accounting and ecosystem stewardship [@johnsonFineresolutionLandscapescaleBiomass2022]

> national forest inventory (NFI) data was used as reference data for modeling forest basal area, volume, above-ground biomass, and total biomass from laser scanning data obtained in a countrywide scanning survey. [@nord-larsenEstimationForestResources2012]

> this study confirm the utility of LiDAR for estimating wood volume in deciduous broad-leafed forest, but highlight the challenges associated with field plot size and number [@levickScalingWoodVolume2016]

> found TLS biomass estimates were consistently more precise across species (RMSE = ~19%) than nation-scale allometry (RMSE = ~39%). Nondestructive biomass estimates from TLS are a suitable addition to or replacement for traditional sampling methods. 
Although optical and airborne LiDAR are unable to fully capture understorey trees due to occlusion, the easily measured canopy trees dominate the biomass. [@stovallDevelopingNondestructiveSpecies2023]

> accounted for uncertainties in both the individual tree-level biomass models and the models linking plot level biomass predictions with LiDAR metrics.
75% of the mean square error was due to the uncertainty associated with tree-level models. [@saarelaMappingAbovegroundBiomass2020]

> ground filtering should be a carefully considered decision when mapping forest AGB, particularly when mapping heterogeneous and highly fragmented landscapes [@mahoneyFilteringGroundNoise2022]

> Estimating the above-ground biomass in forests using airborne laser scanning (ALS) is now an operational practice in Northern Europe and is being adopted in many parts of the world.
ALS data can be used indirectly through a chain of models to estimate soil carbon changes in addition to changes in biomass at the primary level of forest management, namely the forest stands. [@strimbuEstimatingBiomassSoil2023]

> Dual-wavelength ALS was used in a two-step methodology to classify species, and estimate species-specific stem volume at the level of individual tree crowns. Demonstrate the added benefit of the green channel for the estimation of both species composition and species-specific stem volumes. [@axelssonUseDualwavelengthAirborne2023]

> errors in species composition have less impact on individual tree volume estimates than errors in height measurement. The implications of these results are that, with very accurate estimates of height provided by ALS and knowledge of what dominant species is expected in a stand, accurate estimates of volume can be generated in the absence of more detailed species composition information. [@tompalskiSimulatingImpactsError2014]

> simulated data cannot yet replace real data but they can be helpful in some sites to extend training datasets when only a limited amount of real data is available. [@schaferAssessingPotentialSynthetic2023]

> this study showcases the effectiveness of additive tree AGB models and highlights the potential of DNNs for enhanced AGB estimation. Compared deep learning and random forest models in terms of biomass estimation. Deep neural networks provided small performance gain compared to random forest. [@seelyModellingTreeBiomass2023]
