### Lidar-based data products

#### Point Cloud Data
The "raw" LiDAR data product is collection of point data, made up by 3-dimensional (X, Y, Z) points (the location) with optional other attributes such as intensity, classification of features and GPS time. These point clouds can consist of millions to billions of points. 
The standard data format for point clouds is *LAS* or *LAZ* files. The LAS file format is a standard binary file format to store and interchange 3-d point cloud data and the *LAZ* file format is simply a compressed version of *LAS*. Other (older) file formats for point data include text files such as ASCII XYZ files. These non-binary formats are not very effective but unfortunately still used by many distributors.
The latest LAS specification is LAS 1.4 (more information can be found at [asprs.org](https://www.asprs.org/divisions-committees/lidar-division/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities)).

#### Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
A Digital Elevation Model is a digital representation of the elevation of the Earthâ€™s surface typically above mean sea level. There are two types of DEMs, Digital surface models and Digital Terrain models, briefly described below. 

#### Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
A Digital Terrain Model approximates the continuous terrain surface by a set of discrete points with unique height values. The DTM does not include features like buildings or trees.

#### Digital Surface Model (DSM)
A Digital Surface Model is created by the interpolation of individual points containing the elevation characteristics of natural or human-made elements such as trees, buildings etc.

#### Canopy Height Model (CHM)
A Canopy Height Model is often referred to as a normalized surface model (nDSM). Sometimes, but not always, it is limited to vegetated areas (excluding buildings etc.).
