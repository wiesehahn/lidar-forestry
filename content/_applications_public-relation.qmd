### Public relation

Apart from quantitative analyses lidar point clouds and derived products can also be used to communicate and vizualize information. A good example can be seen a movie about the project "Gr√ºnes Gallustal", where ALS data was acquired to capture the city status. This digital twin was then enhanced with planned city developments to create a video for communicating the project ideas (https://www.gruenesgallustal.ch/).
Lidar data is also used in documentaries to vizualize forests in other perspectives (e.g. [The Giants](https://documentaryaustralia.com.au/project/the-giants/))
