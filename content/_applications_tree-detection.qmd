### Individual Tree Detection

> assessed seven ITD methods, representing three common approaches (point-cloud-based, raster-based, hybrid), across coniferous forest stands with diverse structure and composition to understand how ITD and height measurement accuracy vary with method, input parameters and data, and stand density. [@sparksCrossComparisonIndividualTree2022]

> aimed to develop a tool for individual tree detection (ITD) utilising a self-calibrating algorithm procedure and to verify its accuracy using the complicated forest structure of near natural forests in the temperate zone. [@sterenczakMappingIndividualTrees2020]

> This article describes algorithms to extract tree crowns using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) segmentation. For all combinations of algorithms and data resolutions, undetected trees accounted for, on average, 0–5% of the total stem volume in the field plots. [@holmgrenTreeCrownSegmentation2022]

> Numerous semi- and fully-automatic algorithms have been developed for individual tree detection from airborne laser-scanning data [@brodicRefinementIndividualTree2022] 

> The ALS-based tree height estimates were robust across all stand conditions. The taller the tree, the more reliable was the ALS-based tree height. [@wangFieldmeasuredTreeHeight2019]

> The study provides new insight regarding the potential and limits of tree detection with ALS and underlines some key aspects regarding the choice of method when performing single tree detection for the various forest types encountered in alpine regions. [@eysnBenchmarkLidarBasedSingle2015]

> proposed a novel ITC segmentation method based on computer vision theory which combines a dual Gaussian filter and a treetop screening strategy to achieve a flexible filtering process for varying tree sizes and the exclusion of false treetops generated by lateral branches. [@yunIndividualTreeCrown2021]

> successfully apply a lidar-based method based on the 3D adaptive mean shift (AMS3D) technique to estimate individual tree size and density. [@ferrazLidarDetectionIndividual2016]

> ITD accuracy was high in stands with lower canopy cover and lower in stands with higher canopy cover, mainly owing to omission of suppressed trees that were not detected under the dominant tree canopy. @sparksAccuracyLiDARBasedIndividual2021

### Individual Tree Segmentation 

> This study compared the accuracy of four representative individual tree segmentation (ITS) algorithms against benchmark data sets in temperate and tropical forests. We found that all four ITS algorithms were able to segment canopy trees accurately but performed poorly for the understory trees [@caoTreeSegmentationAirborne2022]

> propose a framework for individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation from laser data that focuses on both overstory and understory trees. 
achieve ITC segmentation for forests with various structural attributes. The results also illustrate the potential of using ALS data to delineate low vegetation." [@huoLowVegetationIdentification2022]

> two instance segmentation methods, Mask R–CNN and DETR, were applied to precisely delineate single tree crowns using multispectral images and images generated from UAV lidar data. [@derschCompleteTreeCrown2023]

> compared the performance of four widely used tree segmentation algorithms. 
All algorithms performed reasonably well on the canopy trees. However, all algorithms failed to accurately segment the understory trees. [@caoBenchmarkingAirborneLaser2023]
