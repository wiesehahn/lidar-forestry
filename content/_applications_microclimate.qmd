> linking microclimate measurements with remote sensing data on key predictors of microclimate
spatially continuous structural or spectral data on vegetation and terrain structures can be obtained from ... e.g., thermal imaging or lidar [@kemppinenjuliaMicroclimateInseparablePart2023]

> used LiDAR for predicting summer temperature offsets in a mountain forest landscape. 
Forest canopy openness and elevation were most important for predicting temperature offsets. [@vandewieleMappingSpatialMicroclimate2023]

> Airborne LiDAR is ideal to predict forest thermal environment at a high resolution.
Forest structure explained 91% of microclimate variability at a 10-m resolution.
We mapped the buffering or amplification effect of forest on microclimate temperature. [@grilUsingAirborneLiDAR2023]
