### Tree Growth

Using repeat airborne LiDAR to map the growth of individual trees and forest stands

> use spatially explicit information on tree location and competition to forecast potential tree height, defined as a maximum projected tree height at rotation age [@gavilan-acunaEstimatingPotentialTree2022]

> The height growth of >500,000 individual oil palms was mapped using repeat LiDAR. [@beeseUsingRepeatAirborne2022]

> prediction of the periodic annual increment (PAI) of the width of tree rings over a period of 10 years. [@maltamoEstimationPeriodicAnnual2022]

> importance of assessing and harmonizing the vertical alignment of multi-temporal ALS data sets used for height growth calculations [@riofrioHarmonizingMultitemporalAirborne2022]

> it is possible to determine long-term diameter and stem volume growth values of individual trees from bitemporal airborne laser scanning point cloud data with reasonable accuracy, apart from height growth, which can be obtained with high accuracy [@soininenPredictingGrowthIndividual2022]

> with TLS data acquisition and existing point cloud processing methods, it is possible to observe seasonal increments in tree structures [@yrttimaaCapturingSeasonalRadial2023]

> This study explored the use of point cloud-derived forest inventory information, representing two points in time, to find the best matching yield curve at a 20 by 20 m cell level to support growth simulation modelling. [@tompalskiCombiningMultiDateAirborne2018]

> used a combination of fire behavior and heat flux metrics, along with multitemporal field and ALS measurements to quantify fire intensity impacts on mature tree height growth [@sparksIntegratingActiveFire2023]

> Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) opens up the possibility of describing the three-dimensional structures of trees in natural environments with unprecedented detail and accuracy. It is already being extensively applied to describe how ecosystem biomass and structure vary between sites, but can also facilitate major advances in developing and testing mechanistic theories of tree form and forest structure, thereby enabling us to understand why trees and forests have the biomass and three-dimensional structure they do.
