### Site Index

> Integrating multi-temporal ALS data and an age-independent approach allows for the mapping of height increments over large areas at a finer spatial resolution than is commonly possible with conventional forest inventory data and stand-level, age-dependent, models. Moreover, the growth rate index provides a continuous measure of site quality at a high spatial resolution that can be readily used in forest growth and yield modeling. The approach developed and demonstrated here can be adapted to multi-sensor data sources (ALS and DAP) that would increase the data available to support spatially explicit characterizations of height and height growth over large spatial extents.

> explored the potential of bi-temporal ALS data and other auxiliary information to predict and map site productivity by site index according to site properties. Final predictors of site index include metrics of 90th percentile height and annual increment in the 95th percentile height, altitude, distance to coast, and soil moisture.
