> mapping of tree speciesâ€”subdivided into conifers and broadleaf trees [@krzystekLargeScaleMappingTree2020]

> This paper compares the same method of tree species identification (at the individual crown level) across three different types of airborne laser scanning systems (ALS): two linear lidar systems (monospectral and multispectral) and one single-photon lidar (SPL) system. The additional intensity features that are provided by multispectral ALS appear to be more beneficial to overall accuracy than the higher point density of SPL. [@prieurComparisonThreeAirborne2021]

> laser scanning data was used to mask pixels with low or no vegetation [@trierTreeSpeciesClassification2018]

> Deciduous trees displayed substantial between-species variation that was linked with differences in branching pattern, leaf orientation and bark reflectance.
Our results provide new insights for enhancing tree species identification by using WF LiDAR and for LiDAR time-series analysis of vegetation. [@korpelaInfluencePhenologyWaveform2023]

> the addition of 3D derivatives (from LiDAR or photogrammetry) could help segregate between different species if these species have different architectural properties. [@camarrettaMonitoringForestStructure2020]

> objective of this study was to map dominant species groups across a large (>580,000 ha) boreal forest by combining area-based and individual tree metrics derived from single photon LiDAR data with multispectral information derived from Sentinel-2 imagery [@queinnecMappingDominantBoreal2023]

> presents a method of tree species classification using individual tree metrics derived from a three-dimensional point cloud from unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) [@slavikSpatialAnalysisDense2023]

> The fusion of spectral information from optical images and the structural information provided by ALS was highly advantageous in studies where tree species were considered. [@toivonenAssessingBiodiversityUsing2023]
