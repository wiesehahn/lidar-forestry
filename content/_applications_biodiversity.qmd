> LiDAR technology has proved to be powerful when assessing forest structural parameters, and it may be a promising way to identify existing overmature forest patches over large areas. We first built an index combining several forest structural maturity attributes in order to characterize the structural maturity. [@fuhrDetectingOvermatureForests2022]

> Canopy roughness, ground vegetation vertical complexity, total vegetation volume and canopy height derived from lidar sensors were among the most common significant variables in explaining avian diversity and individual species abundance. [@shokirovHabitatHighsLows2023]

> Continued emphasis to enhance forest stewardship is promoting novel methods to integrate ALS to detail non-timber ecosystem values like habitat, soil, and water.
review and highlight the value of ALS for quantifying indicators of biological diversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil and water, and the role of forests in global ecological cycles. [@goodbodyAirborneLaserScanning2021]

> Combining satellite and airborne remote sensing data outperforms single data sources for habitat mapping significantly. [@iglsederPotentialCombiningSatellite2023]

> Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has the potential to radically alter the way researchers and managers collect data on wildlifeâ€“habitat relationships. To date, the technology has fostered several novel approaches to characterizing avian habitat.
approach provide a useful framework to extract detailed and reliable habitat attributes for a forest-dwelling habitat specialist, broadening the potential to apply LiDAR in conservation and management of wildlife populations. [@garabedianQuantitativeAnalysisWoodpecker2014]

> To understand time-lag dynamics in the response of biodiversity to contemporary environmental changes (e.g. macroclimate warming and atmospheric pollution), we need to consider former anthropogenic forcing factors such as past land uses and management practices.
We encourage plant and soil ecologists to use LiDAR data to account for time-lagged biotic responses to long-term macro-environmental changes. [@lenoirUnveilUnseenUsing2022]

> demonstrated innovative techniques to semi-automatically classify forest structure and rapidly quantify soundscape characteristics and found a weak effect of forest edge structure on bird biophony. [@verhelstForestEdgeStructure2023]

> present a new spatially continuous method to map regional patterns of tree functional diversity using combined laser scanning and imaging spectroscopy. [@schneiderMappingFunctionalDiversity2017]
