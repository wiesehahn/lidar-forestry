### Shading conditions

With precise forest structure and height information from lidar data it is possible to calculate sun exposure times and solar radiation. 

> The basic assumption on which plant area density estimation is based is that light attenuation is proportional to vegetation area density. [@vincentMultisensorAirborneLidar2023]

> LiDAR can be a suitable tool for modeling solar radiation at various levels and producing continuous information across large forested areas with complicated structure and species composition. [@olpendaEstimationSubcanopySolar2019]

> light detection and ranging has, so far, been preferably used for modeling light under tree canopies. Laser systemâ€™s capability of generating 3D canopy structure at high spatial resolution makes it a reasonable choice as a source of spatial information about light condition in various parts of forest ecosystem.
