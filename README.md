## Lidar for Forestry

This repository is meant as a personal space to gather and organize information about research and applications of lidar data for forestry. 

Information is collected via Github issues and rudimentally organized by Tags. For example its possible to filter recent [literature](https://github.com/wiesehahn/lidar-forestry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aliterature+) about lidar applications for forestry.

This information is further summarized as a [website](https://wiesehahn.github.io/lidar-forestry/) (updated irregularly from time to time).
